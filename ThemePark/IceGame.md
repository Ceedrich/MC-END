# Ice Game

TODO: How can the time be messured?

The goal of this game is to stay on the ice for as long as possible.

## Mechanics

The general mechanic making this game possible is the fact that frost walker works on armor stands which can be launched by sticky pistons with slime.

In the past, I built a such game in a tunnel because a single slime block can only launch the armor stand so far. It may be possible though to make intermediary launchers or even flying machines to move the armor stand further.

It is also important to note that the ice does not smelt unless the light level is high enough.
